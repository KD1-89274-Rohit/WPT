    <h1>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)<sub>[edit]</sub></h1>
    <p>
        <pre>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <b>markup language <sup>[a]</sup></b> for documents designed to be displayed in a <b>web browser</b>. 
        It defines the content and structure of <b>web content.</b>
        It is often assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript</b>, a programming language.

    <pre>
        <b>Web browsers</b> receive HTML documents from a <b>web server</b> or from local storage and <b>render</b> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <b><u>web page semantically</u></b> and originally included cues for its appearance.

    <pre>
        <b>HTML</b> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
        <b>HTML</b> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
        Tags such as <pre><img></pre> and <pre><input></pre> directly introduce content into the page. 
        Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        <u>
            Browsers do not display the <b>HTML</b> tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
